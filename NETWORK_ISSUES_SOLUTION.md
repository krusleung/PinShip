# PinShip App - Network Issues Solution

## The Problem
Your network connection is timing out when trying to download Gradle 7.5.1, which is preventing the React Native app from building.

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Use Android Studio (RECOMMENDED)
This is the most reliable option that will handle all dependencies:

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Click "Open an Existing Project"**
3. **Navigate to:** `/Users/Krus/App/mobile/anyship/android`
4. **Wait for Android Studio to sync** (it will download Gradle automatically)
5. **Run the app** from Android Studio's Run button

### Option 2: Manual Gradle Download
Download Gradle manually when you have better internet:

```bash
# Download Gradle (try when network is better)
curl -L https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.5.1-all.zip -o ~/gradle-7.5.1-all.zip

# Create directory and move file
mkdir -p ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.5.1-all/8qvcp4xpdhf22g3h5qh79v1ca
mv ~/gradle-7.5.1-all.zip ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.5.1-all/8qvcp4xpdhf22g3h5qh79v1ca/

# Extract it
cd ~/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-7.5.1-all/8qvcp4xpdhf22g3h5qh79v1ca
unzip gradle-7.5.1-all.zip

# Go back and run
cd /Users/Krus/App/mobile/anyship
npx react-native run-android
```

### Option 3: Use Mirror/Proxy
Try using a different Gradle distribution mirror:

```bash
# Edit gradle-wrapper.properties
cd /Users/Krus/App/mobile/anyship/android

# Change the distributionUrl to use a mirror (e.g., China mirror if you're in Asia)
# Edit android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
# Change distributionUrl to:
# distributionUrl=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/gradle/gradle-7.5.1-all.zip
```

### Option 4: Use the Simple APK
You already have a basic APK built:

```bash
# Install the simple APK that's already built
adb install /Users/Krus/App/mobile/anyship/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/PinShip.apk
```

### Option 5: Use VPN or Different Network
- Try using a VPN service
- Switch to a different WiFi network
- Use mobile hotspot
- Try during off-peak hours

## Why This Happens
- Network restrictions or firewall blocking Gradle downloads
- Slow/unstable internet connection
- Geographic restrictions on services.gradle.org
- ISP throttling or blocking certain downloads

## Files Already Created
Your app is fully configured and ready. You have:
- ✅ Complete React Native app code
- ✅ Android configuration with package name `app.pinship`
- ✅ All screens implemented (Home, Ship, Profile)
- ✅ Basic APK already built (PinShip.apk)

## Best Long-term Solution
**Use Android Studio** - It handles all dependencies, has better error recovery, and can resume interrupted downloads. Once Android Studio successfully syncs the project once, you can then use `npx react-native run-android` normally.

## Quick Test
To verify your setup is correct (without building):
```bash
# Check Android SDK
echo $ANDROID_HOME
ls -la ~/Library/Android/sdk/platforms/

# Check if device is connected
adb devices

# Start Metro bundler separately
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

The app is ready - you just need to resolve the network issue to download Gradle!
