## Build Requirements

To build the APK, you need:

1. **Android Studio** installed on your machine
2. **Android SDK** (API Level 33)
3. **Node.js** version 16 or higher
4. **Java JDK** version 11 or higher

## Manual Build Steps

Since there are network connectivity issues with automated builds, you can build the APK manually:

### Option 1: Build with Android Studio

1. Open Android Studio
2. Select "Open an existing Android Studio project"
3. Navigate to `/Users/Krus/App/mobile/anyship/android`
4. Wait for the project to sync
5. Click on **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**
6. The APK will be generated at:
   `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Option 2: Build from Command Line

If you have Android development environment set up:

```bash
# Navigate to android directory
cd /Users/Krus/App/mobile/anyship/android

# Clean previous builds
./gradlew clean

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# The APK will be in:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Option 3: Simple Native Build

For a quick native Android build without React Native:

1. The app includes a `SimpleMainActivity.java` that creates a basic native Android interface
2. This can be built directly without React Native dependencies
3. Open in Android Studio and build normally

## App Features Summary

- **Brand Color**: #f20c00 (PinShip Red)
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation with 3 tabs
- **Tracking**: Real-time shipment tracking with map view
- **Shipping Options**: Local (Pin-ship, Speed Post) and Overseas (Coming Soon)
- **User Settings**: Profile management, theme, language
- **Live Chat**: Customer service integration ready

## Testing the App

Once built, you can install the APK on an Android device or emulator:

```bash
# Install on connected device/emulator
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:

1. **Gradle Issues**: Update gradle wrapper properties to use a local gradle distribution
2. **Network Issues**: Configure proxy settings if behind a firewall
3. **Dependency Issues**: Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` for dependency conflicts
4. **SDK Issues**: Ensure ANDROID_HOME is set correctly in your environment

## Next Steps

The app is ready for:
- Adding real backend integration
- Implementing actual map tracking with Google Maps API
- Adding payment gateway
- Push notifications
- Production release configuration

The complete source code is available in the project directory and can be built using standard Android development tools.
